## Overview

I have engaged in numerous competitive programming challenges across platforms such as  
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Hasban-Fardani/completed)  
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/hasbanfardani77)  
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/Hasban-Fardani/)  
- [TLX TOKI Indonesia](https://tlx.toki.id/profiles/hasban/submission-history)  

This experience has allowed me to tackle a variety of algorithmic problems, enhancing my coding proficiency and analytical thinking.

## Solution

### Improving Problem-Solving Skills

- **Practice Regularly**: Build consistency and long-term understanding  
- **Analyze Solutions**: Compare with other approaches after solving  
- **Study Concepts**: Focus on theory and its practical application  

### Selecting Problems to Solve

- **By Difficulty**: Start from easy, then increase complexity  
- **By Topic**: Focus on key areas like DP, graphs, recursion, etc.  
- **By Relevance**: Choose problems useful for interviews and real-world scenarios  

### Additional Strategies

- **Join Contests**: Timed events improve focus and speed  
- **Take Notes**: Summarize tricks, patterns, and key takeaways  
- **Community Engagement**: Share solutions, discuss approaches, learn from others
