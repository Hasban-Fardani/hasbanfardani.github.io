[Final Thoughts](#final-thoughts)  \n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nI have engaged in numerous competitive programming challenges across platforms such as  \n- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Hasban-Fardani/completed)  \n- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/hasbanfardani77)  \n- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/Hasban-Fardani/)  \n- [TLX TOKI Indonesia](https://tlx.toki.id/profiles/hasban/submission-history)  \n\nThis experience has allowed me to tackle a variety of algorithmic problems, enhancing my coding proficiency and analytical thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Problem\n\nIn software development and technical interviews, strong problem-solving skills are essential. Recognizing this, I began practicing competitive programming. It has helped sharpen my logic, speed, and confidence in coding.\n\n---\n\n## Goal\n\n- Improve analytical and problem-solving abilities  \n- Deepen understanding of data structures and algorithms  \n- Write efficient, accurate code  \n- Prepare for coding interviews and technical assessments  \n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\n### Improving Problem-Solving Skills\n\n- **Practice Regularly**: Build consistency and long-term understanding  \n- **Analyze Solutions**: Compare with other approaches after solving  \n- **Study Concepts**: Focus on theory and its practical application  \n\n### Selecting Problems to Solve\n\n- **By Difficulty**: Start from easy, then increase complexity  \n- **By Topic**: Focus on key areas like DP, graphs, recursion, etc.  \n- **By Relevance**: Choose problems useful for interviews and real-world scenarios  \n\n### Additional Strategies\n\n- **Join Contests**: Timed events improve focus and speed  \n- **Take Notes**: Summarize tricks, patterns, and key takeaways  \n- **Community Engagement**: Share solutions, discuss approaches, learn from others  \n\n---\n\n## Challenges and Learnings\n\n- **Time Management**: Balancing consistent practice with other responsibilities  \n- **Technical Difficulties**: Breaking down and understanding hard problems  \n- **Motivation**: Staying consistent over time  \n\nFrom these, I learned to plan better, study smarter, and persist even when progress is slow.\n\n---\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nCompetitive programming continues to help me grow as a developer. It strengthens core skills that are essential in both academic and professional environments. With consistent effort, this practice remains one of the most effective ways to build coding confidence.","src/content/projects/2.pinterest-clone.mdx",[28],"139a05c8ac8538d1",true,"1finpos-field-visit",{"id":36,"data":38,"body":31,"filePath":48,"assetImports":49,"digest":50,"deferredRender":35},{"title":39,"startDate":40,"endDate":41,"summary":17,"url":18,"cover":19,"tags":42,"ogImage":28,"posistion":29,"published":30},"Finpos Field Visit",["Date","2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"],[43,44,45,46,47],"Laravel","Postgresql","Tailwind","ReactNative","Typescript","src/content/projects/1.finpos-field-visit.mdx",[28],"7f99816a1ac372a7","3sarpras-sebelas",{"id":51,"data":53,"body":31,"filePath":58,"assetImports":59,"digest":60,"deferredRender":35},{"title":54,"startDate":55,"endDate":56,"summary":17,"url":18,"cover":19,"tags":57,"ogImage":28,"posistion":29,"published":30},"Sarpras Sebelas",["Date","2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"],[21,22,23,24,25,26,27],"src/content/projects/3.sarpras-sebelas.mdx",[28],"f3a8ddc65e84a8fb","4rock-paper-scissor-classification",{"id":61,"data":63,"body":31,"filePath":70,"assetImports":71,"digest":72,"deferredRender":35},{"title":64,"startDate":65,"endDate":66,"summary":17,"url":18,"cover":19,"tags":67,"ogImage":28,"posistion":29,"published":30},"Rock Paper Scissors Image Classification",["Date","2024-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-02-01T00:00:00.000Z"],[26,68,69],"Tensorflow","Jupyter Notebook","src/content/projects/4.rock-paper-scissor-classification.mdx",[28],"24a5c3293d9eee11","5competitive-programmings",{"id":73,"data":75,"body":31,"filePath":80,"assetImports":81,"digest":82,"deferredRender":35},{"title":76,"startDate":77,"endDate":78,"summary":17,"url":18,"cover":19,"tags":79,"ogImage":28,"posistion":29,"published":30},"Competitive Programmings",["Date","2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z"],"Present",[21,22,23,24,25,26,27],"src/content/projects/5.competitive-programmings.mdx",[28],"e5647adcb873b2ad","6csr-goverment",{"id":83,"data":85,"body":31,"filePath":94,"assetImports":95,"digest":96,"deferredRender":35},{"title":86,"startDate":87,"endDate":88,"summary":89,"url":18,"cover":19,"tags":90,"ogImage":28,"posistion":29,"published":30},"CSR Goverments",["Date","2024-04-07T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) Goverments",[43,91,92,93,27],"Filament","TailwindCSS","MaryUI","src/content/projects/6.csr-goverment.mdx",[28],"82272f48c6349938","7hf-store",{"id":97,"data":99,"body":31,"filePath":107,"assetImports":108,"digest":109,"deferredRender":35},{"title":100,"startDate":101,"endDate":102,"summary":103,"url":18,"cover":19,"tags":104,"ogImage":28,"posistion":29,"published":30},"HF Store",["Date","2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"Simple E-Commerce for IT Merchandise",[43,105,106],"Mysql","Bootstrap","src/content/projects/7.HF-Store.mdx",[28],"9d73079cf36551aa","8pelita-taras",{"id":110,"data":112,"body":31,"filePath":118,"assetImports":119,"digest":120,"deferredRender":35},{"title":113,"startDate":114,"endDate":115,"summary":116,"url":18,"cover":19,"tags":117,"ogImage":28,"posistion":29,"published":30},"Pelita Taras",["Date","2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"Test",[21,22,23,24,25,26,27],"src/content/projects/8.pelita-taras.mdx",[28],"829f129eaea0050b","9simple-finance-apps",{"id":121,"data":123,"body":31,"filePath":128,"assetImports":129,"digest":130,"deferredRender":35},{"title":124,"startDate":125,"endDate":126,"summary":17,"url":18,"cover":19,"tags":127,"ogImage":28,"posistion":29,"published":30},"Simple Finance Apps",["Date","2023-04-07T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"],[21,22,23,24,25,26,27],"src/content/projects/9.simple-finance-apps.mdx",[28],"1e1c17f5c4d4e8bf"]
